**** UPDATED: 29-FEB-12 - Where you see asterisks !! (Bob F., w9ya)


Installing under Ubuntu 10.10 (or later) using the "classic"(gnome) login;
	- Make sure you have “subversion” installed, via the (Alt+F1, System,
		Administration,) Synaptic Package Manager.
**** 	(Synaptic is no longer installed as default in v. 11.10. You can either;
		- Install it OR
		- Use the new default: Ubuntu Software Center.)
	- IF you want to use the winkeyer interface you will need to also
		install this package;
                	libio-socket-inet6-perl
****	(As of 11.10 libcurses-perl MAY not be installed as default. SO;
		- Install the libcurses-perl package, if the program complains
			about lack of colors or ability to run.)
	- Open up a terminal by;
                typing Ctrl+Alt+t (the plus symbol means you press all of the
			keys the same time)
        - Set aside a place to get to and use your program. I suggest invoking
		this;a
                	mkdir /~/logging/yfktest/ <enter>
				(do NOT type out ‘enter’, rather press that key)
		and then;
                	cd /~/logging/yfktest/ <enter>
		finally this;
          svn checkout svn://dl0tud.tu-dresden.de/yfk/yfktest/trunk <enter>
        


Preparing for use;

****	NOTE: There are many new configurable options. See the startup screen
		for more info.
        - Open up the terminal again (Ctrl+Alt+t) and configure it;
          	from the menu-bar using Edit, Keyboard Shortcuts, making sure
	  	that you change any shortcuts that use F1 through F7, F11, and
	  	any of the Alt-key sequences that yfktest’s internal help page
	  	calls out. (More on the help page below.)
****	NOTE: With ubuntu version 11.10 some or all of this cannot be (easily)
		changed. So; I added Alt-o (make sure your caps lock is off)
		to get to the help screen. No other changes seemed necessary.
        - It’s important to make sure the terminal is showing 24x80 mode. This
		can be set from the Terminal section of the menu-bar's
		selections. 


Testing and Preparing your Winkeyer and the interface;
	- Your Winkeyer can be either a USB-Winkeyer OR a Serial-Winkreyer
		augmented with a USB-to-serial-cable.
			(These cables work Great in Linux !!)
	- I *strongly* suggest using “WkDemo”, available as a download from
		K1EL’s website, to configure your winkeyer. To run this you
		will need to install ‘Wine’.
        - Install ‘Wine’ using the Synaptic Package Manager. Same way you did
		above to install the inet6-perl module and subversion.
****	- OR use the Ubuntu Software Center application.
        - To allow ‘Wine’ to communicate with your USB connected Winkeyer be
		sure to (again inside a terminal window i.e. Ctrl+Alt+t);
                	cd ~/.wine/dosdevices/ <enter>
                	sudo ln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 com1 <enter>
                ** (Of course if you are using a serial interface then use;
			/dev/ttyS0 instead !)
        - Use WkDemo to setup your Winkeyer settings. I have found this to
		work well even with my VERY old winkeyer (V3 pcb with a V10
		chip) and a dirt-cheap ebay special USB-to-Serial converter
		running on /dev/ttyUSB0. WkDemo is directed to use com1 and
		with the above "ln -s" this is directed to the linux kernel
		drivers using the above command.
	  * NOTE: since only ONE program can access the serial/usb port at a
		time, be sure that you are NOT *ALSO* connected with the
		WkDemo program when using yfktest. (Conversely yfktest
		cannot *ALSO* be using the keyer and so must not be running
		when using WkDemo.)


Running yfktest;
        - Be sure you are in the right place;
                Make sure your terminal is (still) opened up. If not then type
				Ctrl+Alt+t,
			then type;
                                cd /~/logging/yfktest/ <enter>

	- Type: ./yfktest <enter>
                - The first time through you will have to select the
				ARRL-FD template from the window and fill it
				out using the arrow keys and the <enter> key.
            	- Next time through invoke this to select the contest file;
                	./yfktest ARRL-FD.yfk <enter>

	- Play around a bit. Logging is simple with these 6 simple rules;
		- The <tab> key will bring you to the callsign entry “window”
****	NOTE: This can be changed by using the configuration panel whiel the
			yfktest program is running by pressing the alt+c keys.
	      		The behavior can be either:
				a) -  the <tab> key works like the <space> key.
				b) -  the <tab> key snaps you back to the call
					entry field.
		- The <space> bar/key will toggle through the 3 input “windows”
		- The <enter> key will log the completed contact.
		- Alt+o or Alt+h brings up the help screen.
		- Alt+c brings up the configuration screen.
		- If things jam up (like trying to use Alt+k/keyboard CW mode;
			use Alt+w or F11 to erase the exchange/callsign info.
		- If things jam up badly, you can always hit Ctrl+c to force
			the program to quit.


Helpful suggestions;
	- To re-invoke the program after using QUIT or EXIT (in the callsign entry
		field of the contact logging line), you can use the <up-arrow>
		key to scroll back through your previous terminal commands.
****	NOTE: The idea below is to have your station class and section on one cw
		send key (F2) (and one cabrillo log entry per qso).
        - I *strongly* suggest using an ascii text editor (my favorite is
		‘nano’) to add a space to separate the class and section keying
		output. This is on line number 10 of the following file.
			Invoke editing like this;
                        	nano -w ARRL.yfk <enter>
                                	(then scroll down to line number 10.)
