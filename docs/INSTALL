yfktest is the executable file, nothing to install or setup. See docs/README
	docs/MANUAL, and docs/ARRL-FD-HOW-TO.TXT for more information.

** Note this version runs from the directory where the files were downloaded to.
	Untested coding for a full-packaged-styled install including placement
	via $PREFIX and similar variables reside in the misc/ directory.
