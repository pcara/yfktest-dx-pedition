YFKtest Version 0.0.10 Manual
----------------------------

If you have not yet downloaded the program please read this link first:
<http://dl0tud.tu-dresden.de/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/yfktest/trunk/README.NOW?view=markup&revision=478&root=yfk>
for instlalation and initial setup information.


1. Getting started
------------------

To start a new contest, just invoke YFKtest without any arguments on the command
line: ./yfktest . You'll be asked to select a contest definition and enter
the neccesary details, like a filename for the contest, your callsign, category
etc. After completing this form, the contest operation starts.

You may add a file ~/.yfktest (to your home directory), AND/OR you can add it to
the working directory (where you downloaded yfktest to). It can contain any or
all of the items notated on the first startup screen (the screen you see when
you each time you start yfktest.) There is also a file called
config.yfktest.sample that shows what this file could look like.

OR you can simply use the NEW Alt+c configuration menu while running yfktest to
set up ALL of the possible configuration possibilities.


2. Loading an existing log
--------------------------

To load an existing contest log, invoke YFKtest with the filename as the
command like argument:  ./yfktest CQWW07.yfk
The contest log will be read, user settings from the last contest are restored
and the score will be calculated. 

Alternatively a file browser can be used to select a log from the file system.
You will see this as the second screen (i.e. after you press <enter> from the
stratup or first screen) if yfktest was started without any command line
arguments.


3. Keys and functions
---------------------

Alt+w, F11  Wipe QSO. Delete callsign- and exchange fields.

Alt+x       Stops CW sending immediately (like ESC). 

Alt+o or h  Quick help screen.

Alt+k       Keyboard-Mode in CW.

Alt+r       Rate Graph.

Alt+m       Edit CW messages.

Alt+c       Edit configuration settings. Add "ops" for multi/club outings.

F1..9       CW messages like in CT. #1-7 can be modified by Alt-m, and
INS         are written to the log file and restored when restarting the
ESC         contest.

10M..160M   Entering the desired band in the callsign-field causes YFKtest to
            QSY. **** NOTE: You can also just enter a freq. like 21075 to
	    switch to 15 meters...and so forth !

SSB, CW     Change the mode my entering SSB/CW in the callsign field. (RTTY
	    works too.)

UP/DOWN     Edit log. Entering DEL in-place of the call will erase the qso.

PG-UP/DOWN  Change the cw sending speed.

WRITELOG    Writes the log in Cabrillo- and ADIF-Format for submission to the
            log-checker and / or import to your main logbook/LOTW etc.
            Also a summary file of the contest score is written to a file.

QUIT, EXIT  Enter this int he callsign field to end the program execution.


4. Hamlib
---------

As of version 0.0.4, CAT control of the transceiver is supported via Hamlib's
Perl bindings.

When starting a new contest, you'll be asked wheter you want to use rig
control. If so, you can select one of the transceivers supported by hamlib and
a device to which the RIG is connected. All available transceivers are saved in
the file 'hamlibrigs'. You can delete all transceivers which you are not using
from this file to reduce the number of RIGs to scroll through.

During operation, YFKtest will query the rig freqency and mode every second or
so, and update the values in the logbook. The other direction also works: If
you change the band in YFKtest (by typing for example 15M), your radio will
jump to the 15m band. You can also enter a frequency in the callsign field,
like 14025, and the radio will QSY to 14025kHz.

FYI: Debian's hamlib Perl package is still broken. YFKtest will crash if you
try to use it; either compile it yourself from the source, or uncomment the
lines which import Hamlib.pm  in yfktest.pl.


5. CW Functions
---------------

CW is realized via the winkeydaemon.pl code. Winkeydaemon  uses the
configuration settings dialog which can be accessed by pressing alt+c. Upon
re-starting yfktest you will be greeted by a daemon setup menu. At each restart
yfktest will automagically start the daemon again. The automatic daemon start
can be de-selected using the alt+c menu. If you need to change to another port,
(for instance,) you can erase the winkeydaemon.sh file (being careful NOT to
erase the winkeyerdaemon.pl file) & then start the entire setup process again.

(Currently PG4I's cwdaemon is "officially" NOT supported. HOWEVER you are
welcome to test it by making sure it is running BEFORE starting yfktest. Please
let us know how well this works for you !!)

The F-keys are set similarly to CT by default: (*** NOTE: These defaults can be
automagically changed by the entries in the various contest definition files
that are used by yfktest to setup a contest log. They can also be changed by
pressing the alt+m keys during logging.)

F1: CQ
F2: RST +/or Exchange
F3: TU $MYCALL
F4: MYCALL
F5: HISCALL
F6: NR?
F7: ?


And these are available, but permamently coded. (i.e. You cannot edit these.):

F8: 73
F9: SRI WRKED B4

Alt+k activates the Keyboard-Mode, meaning everything you type in is
immediately sent via cwdaemon or winkeydaemon.pl . Alt-K again or ESC stops it.
