YFKtest TODO list (feel free to add things!)
--------------------------------------------


As of 29 Feb. 2012 - w9ya
(PLUS A few additions as of 22 Mar. 2012 - w9ya)
(And a few deletions !!! as of 25 Mar. 2012 - w9ya)
(And even more adds/moves/changes as of 09 Apr. 2012 - w9ya)


TO-DO (Before next release):

Fix esc-key i.e. allow immediate &sendcw('esc') from the esc-key as well as the alt+x keypress.
Fix the intended (?/apparently) restoration of $tmpqso to restore (line22) fields aftr. editing.
 
.......... ARRL-FD seems to replace "NR" as '5?' .
.......... Winkey set-up screen needs info on which keys to use, perhaps status (red line 23 ?)
..........   "      "    - Are the selections themselves properly declared ?

** DONE ? - Decide on either a new config file selection OR a permament (arrl-fd) dummy.file select.
See if ANY routines are better moved from "main".pl to subs/ .
See if ANY code within ANY subroutines (or yfktest) can be turned into more subs.
DOC files updated;
... and rearranged as needed.
... and (maybe) create doc abt. sample config file & possibly make config file self documenting !
Make sure ALL of the above works from a "cold" start.
Add in the new 'database' files de: ct1drb.
Check for any more adds/move/changes that are on paper.
DOUBLE-check older to-do files for anything not yet done.
DOUBLE CHECK "supposedly fixes" with third party testing !
Get Fabian ready for a 0.0.10 release !!


WISH-LIST (Long term ideas):

Make "DEFS_HOW_TO" (plus template?) (requested by Jeff, KA1DBE)
Consider method to add more to defs while still allowing current style def files.
VA-QSO-Party rules for scoring and cabrillo submissions brings out four issues;
..... yfktest dupes are strictly based on callsign field YET VA-QSO considers a dupe based on
		band-mode-county. Many other logging programs suggests adding /??? for county
		to allow for dupes logging since they are not dupes, ** yfktest does not need this
..... Call check window will ONLY show the last band-mode dupe...yet there can be more than one
		since this contest is structured as band-mode-county = dupe
	PLUS window does not (nec.) indicate mode either !!!
..... Multiple of 3 are NOT allowed for mobile station but ONLY for the contact WITH the mobile..
..... Multiples are not scored per band-mode.
************** Thanks to Jeff, KA1DBE (user) and Dick, W2YE ... VA-QSO Rules Comittee Member.
DXPED logging uses different colors and info in the summary window...
...incorporate similar scoring window for ARRL-FD yet still have mults correctly calculated.
Finish removing rig control & winkeyer setups 2 sub-directory/ i.e. references to TWO file
.. locations - local and in sub-directory for .sh files.
... then test for operation including minimal config file.

Show qso-in-log blacked-out /t same aftr. as b4 going into rate or help screens from EDIT mode.
Consider having section info in ARRL-FD (for instance) color in sections worked.

(Fix file select screens to kill working screen before asking for exit on bad file selection.)
... and/OR (& IF POSSIBLE) move all the log files into a separate directory for cleaner selection.
** IF POSSIBLE; get working atl-H & O (uppercase) in case caps lock is on & help screen is needed.
Scroll horiz. does not work to select new contest (only pre-existing log) ?
Add a way to load various "database" (de: third parties) files.
Correct the ALt-k (and Alt-o) remanant (sp?) character in call field.
Trap or otherwise avoid "baudrate" error message when winkey selected but not connected.
Add DUPECHECKING and RE-SCORING to/immmediately after editing function.
......... the above (most likely) *will*(/could ?) create new problems with qso numbering.
See if ANY routines are better moved from "main".pl to subs/ .



As of 19-24 June 2011 - w9ya
	- Add some sort of ability to select different sized sub-windows AND
	  color schemes. Possibly defaults and selection from either the defs
	  files and/or the ~/.yfktest file.
	- Find a working solution (i.e. easily added in) for adding at least
	  two outgoing exchange fields. OR at the very least find a way to
	  include a space in the one outgoing exchange field during the contest
	  setup dialog.
	- ALT-K now works w/ winkey too - but no "zero" output.
	- Add a CwOps/CWT defs.
	- Work on the HOW-TO stuff....currently called ARRL-FD-HOW-TO. i.e.
	  Try to make it more generic, or at least less kludgy.
	- Is there an adif generation issue ? i.e. Noted that the exchange
	  field is always 5NN. Is this correct for some silly reason ?
	- Create a method to setup and initilize the keyer with options from
	  inside of yfktest.
	- Allow choice of cwdaemon/winkeydaemon as runtime/configfile/ or ??
		(Is cwdaemon still "current" and/or usable ???)
		*** Note: winkeyer ONLY seems to take upppercase characters.
