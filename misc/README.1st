There really is little to no point to installing yfktest. However it you
want to play with such a concept here are some files left by either ct1drb,
ws6z, dj1fyk, oh1fjv, or ??? (SVN messed up and lost the old revs..sorry guys.)

Anyways, if you REALLY want to mess around with such things, the files are
extent here and they are intended to reside in top-level directory for this
program. If you do NOT know what this means, please consider not trying this !
