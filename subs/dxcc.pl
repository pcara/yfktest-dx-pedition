# &dxcc determines the DXCC country of a given callsign using the cty.dat file
# provided by K1EA at http://www.k1ea.com/cty/cty.dat .
# An example entry of the file looks like this:
#
# Portugal:                 14:  37:  EU:   38.70:     9.20:     0.0:  CT:
#     CQ,CR,CR5A,CR5EBD,CR6EDX,CR7A,CR8A,CR8BWW,CS,CS98,CT,CT98;
#
# The first line contains the name of the country, WAZ, ITU zones, continent, 
# latitude, longitude, UTC difference and main Prefix, the second line contains 
# possible Prefixes and/or whole callsigns that fit for the country, sometimes 
# followed by zones in brackets (WAZ in (), ITU in []).
#
# This sub checks the callsign against this list and the DXCC in which 
# the best match (most matching characters) appear. This is needed because for 
# example the CTY file specifies only "D" for Germany, "D4" for Cape Verde.
# Also some "unusual" callsigns which appear to be in wrong DXCCs will be 
# assigned properly this way, for example Antarctic-Callsigns.
# 
# Then the callsign (or what appears to be the part determining the DXCC if
# there is a "/" in the callsign) will be checked against the list of prefixes
# and the best matching one will be taken as DXCC.
#
# The return-value will be an array ("Country Name", "WAZ", "ITU", "Continent",
# "latitude", "longitude", "UTC difference", "DXCC").
